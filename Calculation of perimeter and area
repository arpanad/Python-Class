Code:
-----
pi = 3.14

#Perimeter of circle whose radius is 10.2
radius1 = 10.2
perimeter1 = 2*pi*radius1
print(f"Perimeter of circle with radius {radius1} is {perimeter1}")

#Area of circle whose radius is taken as an input from user
radius2 = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
area = pi*(radius2**2)
print("Area of circle with radius {} is {}".format(radius2, area))

#Perimeter of circle whose radius is taken as an input from user
radius3 = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
perimeter2 = 2*pi*radius2
print("Perimeter of circle with radius {} is {}".format(radius3, perimeter2))

#Area of cone whose radius and hieight is taken as an input from user
cone_radius = int(input("Enter the radius of cone: "))
height = int(input("Enter the height of cone: "))
cone_area = 0.33*pi*(cone_radius**2)*height
print("Area of cone with radius {1} and height {0} is {2}".format(height, cone_radius, cone_area))

Output:
-------
Perimeter of circle with radius 10.2 is 64.056
Enter the radius of the circle: 5.2
Area of circle with radius 5.2 is 84.9056
Enter the radius of the circle: 4.2
Perimeter of circle with radius 4.2 is 32.656000000000006
Enter the radius of cone: 3
Enter the height of cone: 6
Area of cone with radius 3 and height 6 is 55.954800000000006
